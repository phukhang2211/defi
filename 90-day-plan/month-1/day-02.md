- Compare smart contracts to Odoo modules

**Resources:**
- [Finematics: Smart Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE2HxTmxfrI)
- [Ethereum.org: Smart Contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)

**Key Concepts to Understand:**
- Smart contracts are programs that run on blockchain
- They are immutable once deployed
- They can hold and transfer value
- They execute automatically when conditions are met

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Can explain what a smart contract is
- [ ] Understand the difference between smart contracts and traditional software
- [ ] Know why smart contracts are "trustless"

### Task 2: Solidity Syntax Basics (1.5 hours)
**What to do:**
- Learn basic Solidity syntax
- Understand data types
- Practice with simple examples

**Create file: `contracts/SolidityBasics.sol`**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SolidityBasics {
    // State variables (like Odoo model fields)
    string public name;
    uint256 public age;
    bool public isActive;
    address public owner;
    
    // Events (like Odoo logging)
    event PersonAdded(string name, uint256 age);
    event StatusChanged(bool newStatus);
    
    // Constructor (like Odoo __init__)
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        name = "Default";
        age = 0;
        isActive = false;
    }
    
    // Function modifiers (like Odoo security rules)
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
        _;
    }
    
    // Functions (like Odoo methods)
    function addPerson(string memory _name, uint256 _age) public {
        name = _name;
        age = _age;
        isActive = true;
        
        emit PersonAdded(_name, _age);
    }
    
    function toggleStatus() public onlyOwner {
        isActive = !isActive;
        emit StatusChanged(isActive);
    }
    
    // View function (like Odoo computed field)
    function getPersonInfo() public view returns (string memory, uint256, bool) {
        return (name, age, isActive);
    }
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Understand basic data types (string, uint256, bool, address)
- [ ] Know how to declare state variables
- [ ] Understand function modifiers
- [ ] Know how to emit events

### Task 3: Practice with Remix IDE (1 hour)
**What to do:**
- Go to [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)
- Create a new file called `Practice.sol`
- Copy and paste the SolidityBasics contract
- Compile and deploy it
- Test all functions

**Steps in Remix:**
1. Create new file: `Practice.sol`
2. Paste the contract code
3. Compile (Ctrl+S or click Compile)
4. Deploy to JavaScript VM
5. Test each function:
   - Call `addPerson` with your name and age
   - Call `getPersonInfo` to see the result
   - Try `toggleStatus` (should fail if not owner)
   - Switch accounts and try `toggleStatus` again

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Contract compiles without errors in Remix
- [ ] Can deploy contract successfully
- [ ] Can call functions and see results
- [ ] Understand why some functions fail with different accounts

### Task 4: Understanding Gas and Transactions (1 hour)
**What to do:**
- Learn about gas fees and transaction costs
- Understand the difference between view and state-changing functions
- Practice gas estimation

**Key Concepts:**
- **Gas**: Unit of computational work
- **Gas Price**: Price per unit of gas (in wei)
- **Transaction Cost**: Gas used √ó Gas price
- **View Functions**: Free to call, don't change state
- **State Functions**: Cost gas, change blockchain state

**Experiment in Remix:**
1. Deploy your contract
2. Call `getPersonInfo()` (view function) - notice no gas cost
3. Call `addPerson()` (state function) - notice gas cost
4. Try different gas prices and see the difference

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Understand what gas is and why it's needed
- [ ] Know the difference between view and state functions
- [ ] Can estimate gas costs for simple operations

### Task 5: Build a Simple Calculator Contract (1 hour)
**What to do:**
- Create a calculator contract with basic operations
- Practice with different data types and functions

**Create file: `contracts/Calculator.sol`**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Calculator {
    uint256 public lastResult;
    uint256 public operationCount;
    
    event Calculation(uint256 a, uint256 b, string operation, uint256 result);
    
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns (uint256) {
        uint256 result = a + b;
        lastResult = result;
        operationCount++;
        
        emit Calculation(a, b, "add", result);
        return result;
    }
    
    function subtract(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns (uint256) {
        require(a >= b, "Cannot subtract larger number from smaller");
        
        uint256 result = a - b;
        lastResult = result;
        operationCount++;
        
        emit Calculation(a, b, "subtract", result);
        return result;
    }
    
    function multiply(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns (uint256) {
        uint256 result = a * b;
        lastResult = result;
        operationCount++;
        
        emit Calculation(a, b, "multiply", result);
        return result;
    }
    
    function divide(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns (uint256) {
        require(b != 0, "Cannot divide by zero");
        
        uint256 result = a / b;
        lastResult = result;
        operationCount++;
        
        emit Calculation(a, b, "divide", result);
        return result;
    }
    
    function getStats() public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        return (lastResult, operationCount);
    }
}
```

**Test the Calculator:**
1. Deploy in Remix
2. Test each operation with different numbers
3. Check the events tab to see emitted events
4. Call `getStats()` to see the last result and operation count

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Calculator contract works correctly
- [ ] Can perform all basic operations
- [ ] Events are emitted properly
- [ ] Error handling works (division by zero, subtraction)

### Task 6: Compare with Odoo (30 minutes)
**What to do:**
- Think about how this compares to Odoo development
- Write down similarities and differences

**Comparison Exercise:**
| Odoo Concept | Solidity Equivalent | Similarities | Differences |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Model Fields | State Variables | Store data | Immutable once set |
| Methods | Functions | Business logic | Gas costs |
| Security Rules | Modifiers | Access control | More restrictive |
| Computed Fields | View Functions | Read-only data | Free to call |
| Logging | Events | Track changes | Stored on blockchain |

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Can identify at least 5 similarities between Odoo and Solidity
- [ ] Understand key differences in deployment and execution
- [ ] See how your Odoo experience translates to smart contracts
